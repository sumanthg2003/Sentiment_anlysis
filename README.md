"Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning"

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify tweets as either positive or negative.

üìå Project Overview

Social media is a powerful platform to express opinions. Understanding public sentiment can help businesses, researchers, and analysts derive insights. This project:

1.Cleans and preprocesses tweet data.
2.Converts text to numerical features using TF-IDF.
3.Trains classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).
4.Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy and classification reports.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
